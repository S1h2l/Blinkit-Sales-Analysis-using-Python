# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-using-Python
The Blinkit Sales Analysis Project using Python. Cleaned and visualized real-world data to uncover insights on sales by item type, fat content, outlet size, and location. Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build KPI dashboards, enhancing my skills in data storytelling, BI, and customer behavior analysis.
